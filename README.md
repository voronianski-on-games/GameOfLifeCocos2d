## Details

It's one of the implemetations based on the **The Game of Life** - cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. You can check out and compare the same game implemented in [Swift + SpriteKit](https://github.com/voronianski-on-games/GameOfLifeSwift) or [Objective-C + SpriteKit](https://github.com/voronianski-on-games/GameOfLifeSpriteKit).
